Feature: Viewing upcoming statistics announcements

  Scenario: Citizen filters the list of statistics announcements and uses the pagination
    Given there are some statistics announcements
    And there is a cancelled statistics announcement, originally due to be published a few days ago
    When I visit the statistics announcements page
    Then I can see the first page of all the statistics announcements, including the cancelled announcement
    When I navigate to the next page of statistics announcements
    Then I can see the second page of all the statistics announcements
    When I filter the statistics announcements by keyword, from_date and to_date
    And I should only see statistics announcements for those filters

  Scenario: Citizen filters the list of statistics announcements by department and policy area
    Given there are some statistics announcements for various departments and policy areas
    When I visit the statistics announcements page
    And I filter the statistics announcements by department and policy area
    Then I should only see statistics announcements for the selected departments and policy areas

  Scenario: Citizen views the details of a statistics announcement
    Given there is a statistics announcement
    When I visit the statistics announcements page
    And I click on the first statistics announcement
    Then I should be on a page showing the title, release date, organisation, policy area, summary and date change information of the release announcement
